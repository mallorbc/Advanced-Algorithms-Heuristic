# Advanced-Algorithms-Heuristic

## Overview

This was an assignment for advanced algorithms in Spring 2019.  We were given a base of code for generating a connected graph and from there we generated a minimum spanning tree(MST).  From there we were tasked with adding hueristics to improve the score of the algorithm that was given through an evalution function.  The evalution function prioritized limiting the number of edges while still having the nodes well connected.

## Running the code

The easiest way of running this use using Eclipse.

## Results

My teams algorithm was the best overall algorithm with regards to the evalution function, as well a not being centralized to make the graph weak to breakage.
